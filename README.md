# netctl-auto-gnome #
This is a Gnome 3 shell extension for [netctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netctl), the network profile manager for Arch Linux.

This extension was originally the work of Tjaart van der Walt (tjaartvdwalt, netctl-gnome-shell-extension). He has transferred this work to Nigel Michki (nigeil, netctl-auto-gnome) in order to bring it up to current Gnome shell standards and provide netctl-auto support; I thank him for his past pains.

I created this fork in order to learn how to find my way around my current Arch Linux setup and to learn how to write gnome shell extensions.

## Features ##
* Lists all possible wireless network profiles
* Allows selection of active profile at will
* Indicates which profiles are active/unused/disabled
